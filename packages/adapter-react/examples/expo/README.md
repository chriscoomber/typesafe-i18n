## Get started

Start the project in expo:

```bash
npx expo start
```

You can now open the app in Expo Go on a native device, a simulator, or the web, by following the prompts. (If you
want to use a simulator, you will need to install that first. See the Expo docs: 
[Android](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/), 
[iOS](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/).
